# Organizer

As new year and new part of life (start of Master's Degree) comes in, I decided to better organize my time, now what to do when
and when to stop. That's where organizer can come in handy.

## Motivation

Opposing to for example Google Calendar, Organizer will be used to every-day activities, as working time, time for relax, reading
books, etc. Also, this application will be great for finally learn some good practices with React (code structure, responsive design).

## MoSCoW tasks
User MUST be able to:

- See a calendar with events.
- Add / edit / remove events within calendar.
- Add cyclical event to calendar.
- View details of event.
- Add various, non structurized attributes to the event.

User SHOULD be able to:

- Filter events.
- Add importance of events.

User COULD be able to:

- Add notes about events.
- Have a place to draw handwritten notes / drawings.
- Have an option to do some diagrams, flows, etc.

User WOULD be able to:

- Use voice commands to operate on events.

## Stack
Web app in React, desktop app in Electron and mobile app (for beginning) will do as RWD.
Later it would be awesome to use PWD or React Native / Flutter / Kotlin. As for backend and database,
for now it will be more than enough to use Firebase, then Spring / Ktor + MongoDB.
